## Project Overview
This project demonstrates setting up a secure AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using public and private subnets and a **NAT Gateway** to provide outbound internet access for private instances while keeping them unreachable from the public internet. A public EC2 instance is used as a jump host (bastion) to access a private EC2 instance where an Apache web server is installed.

Key goals:
- Create VPC, public & private subnets across AZs.  
- Configure Internet Gateway (IGW) and NAT Gateway for controlled access.  
- Launch EC2 instances (public jump host + private instance).  
- Harden SSH access (custom port) and validate private instance internet access via NAT.
